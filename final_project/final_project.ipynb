    "## Radial Growth of Axons in Rats\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons are the basic unit of the nervous system. They communicate by means of electrical signals, which are transmitted along the length of their axons. The [axon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon) is a long slender projection that extends from the neuronal cell body. The rate of propagation of these signals, and in turn, neuronal function, is influenced by the axonâ€™s diameter; the larger the diameter, the faster signals travel. Thus, the growth of axonal diameter is a crucial developmental process to understand. <br><br>\n",
    "Neurofilaments (NFs) are the most abundant structures that are known for their space-filling role in the axon. They are protein polymers transported along microtubule tracks in the axon. Experimental studies by Hoffman et al. (1984) on the sciatic nerve of rats demonstrated that the number of NFs increases with the axonal cross-sectional area, highlighting NFs' contribution to axonal growth.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In [this very recent study](https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E22-12-0565), these experimental morphometric data were extracted and used to constrain the computational model developed to quantitatively describe how NFs contribute to the modulation of axonal diameter. Results showed that an increase in their influx from the cell body and slowing of their transport along the axon are the two mechanisms in which they help regulate radial growth through development.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In this exercise, we will simulate a small research project: you will use the morphometric data collected by Hoffman et al. (1984 and 1985) from growing axons in the sciatic nerve of rats up to 18 weeks of age to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Plot the data along with the equations describing them;\n",
    "2) Analyze the data to extract crucial information about axonal growth; and\n",
    "3) Compare your findings with the data and interpretations presented in the referenced study.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also practice the other skills you have learned in the 2024 Summer Tutorials, including UNIX and Git. Let's get started.\n",
