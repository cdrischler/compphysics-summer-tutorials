# Fortran-C++ tutorial

This directory contains all resources for the [Fortran-C++ Tutorial](fortran_c_tutorial.md). An illustrative [comparison](language_comparison.ipynb) between code written in C++, Fortran, and Python (and their performances) is also provided.

Furthermore, you can find supplemental information:
* [Fortran compiler flags](fortran_compiler_flags.md)
* [GNU debugger for Fortran](gdb_fortran_tutorial.pdf)
