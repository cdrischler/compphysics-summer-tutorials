    "# Installing GSL\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing `GSL` is straightforward. On Ubuntu, simply run\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "On MacOS, use `homebrew` and run\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "brew install gsl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Manual installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can manually install `GSL`. Let's download the latest version of `GSL`:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/gsl-latest.tar.gz\n",
    "tar -zxvf gsl-latest.tar.gz\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will create the directory (e.g., `gsl-2.7.1`) in the current directory. Change into this directory.\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cd gsl-*.*\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, you need to configure the installation and tell the system where to install the files with the following commands\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "export CC=gcc  # we want to use GCC to compile GSL\n",
    "export CXX=g++\n",
    "./configure --prefix=/home/yourname/src/  # adjust as needed\n",
    "```\n",
    "If there are no errors, compile the library. This step will take several minutes.\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "make -j 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that `-j` specifies the number of jobs (commands) to run simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is necessary to check and test the library before actually installing it. This step will take some time.\n",
    "```shell    \n",
    "make check\n",
    "```\n",
    "If there are no errors, go ahead and install the library with:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "make install\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now that you have the GSL installed, you can remove the `gsl-*.*` directory that was created in your home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using `GSL`\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter describes how to compile programs that use GSL, and introduces its conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example Program\n",
    "The following short program demonstrates the use of the library by computing the value of\n",
    "the Bessel function $J_0(x)$ for $x = 5$,\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>  // for printf()\n",
    "#include <gsl/gsl_sf_bessel.h>\n",
    "int main (void){\n",
    "    double x = 5.0;\n",
    "    double y = gsl_sf_bessel_J0 (x);\n",
    "    printf (\"J0(%g) = %.18e\\n\", x, y);\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Copy this code block to `example.c`. The steps needed to compile this program are described in the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compiling and Linking\n",
    "\n",
    "The library header files are installed in their own `include` directory. You should write any preprocessor include statements with a `gsl/` directory prefix thus,\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#include <gsl/gsl_math.h>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `include` directory is not installed on the standard search path of your compiler, you will also need to provide its location to the preprocessor as a command line flag. Depending on your operating system and the chosen install path (i.e., `--prefix`), the location of gsl may vary. Use `gsl-config` to determine\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "gsl-config --cflags  # include directory\n",
    "# the output is, e.g., -I/usr/local/Cellar/gsl/2.7.1/include\n",
    "gsl-config --libs  # for linking\n",
    "# the output is, e.g., -L/usr/local/Cellar/gsl/2.7.1/lib -lgsl -lgslcblas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical compilation command for a source file `example.c` with the GNU C compiler gcc is,\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    "gcc -Wall -I/usr/local/include -c example.c\n",
    "```\n",
    "This results in an object file `example.o`. The default include path for gcc searches `/usr/local/include` automatically so the `-I` option can actually be omitted when GSL is installed in its default location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compile the program with the following commands (but use the correct path for your username):\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "gcc -Wall -I/home/yourname/gsl/include -c example.c\n",
    "```\n",
    "This created the `example.o` object file (because of the flag `-c`). To create an executable, we need to link the object file with GSL (and other libraries):\n",
    "```shell \n",
    "gcc example.o -L/home/yourname/gsl/lib -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm\n",
    "```\n",
    "The (static) GSL library is installed as a single archive (file), `libgsl.a`. You can look into the archive file by typing `ar -t libgsl.a` in the terminal. A shared version of the library `libgsl.so` is also installed on systems that support shared libraries. The typical location of these files is `/usr/local/lib` on Linux systems. If this directory is not on the standard search path of your linker, you will also need to provide its location as a command line flag. Again, `gsl-config` helps you identify the path to this location (see above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now run your program!\n",
    "```\n",
    "./a.out\n",
    "```\n",
    "The output is shown below, and should be correct to double-precision accuracy,\n",
    "\n",
    "    J0(5) = -1.775967713143382920e-01\n",
    "\n",
    "The last few digits may vary slightly depending on the compiler and platform used—this is normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can also compile and link in one step:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "gcc example.c -Wall -I/home/yourname/gsl/include -L/home/yourname/gsl/lib -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's revisit the compiler flags:\n",
    "- `-Wall`: This turns on a set of warnings for common programming problems. You\n",
    "need `-Wall`, but it is not enough on its own (for g++).\n",
    "- `-I<path>`: specifies a path where the compiler searches for include (i.e., header) files\n",
    "- `-L<path>`: species a path where the compiler searches for libraries, in this case, `libgsl.a` because of the flag `-lgsl` (which translate to `-libgsl.a`). Alternatively, we could have specified the full path of the `libgsl.a` file without the corresponding flag `-l` and `-L`\n",
    "- `-lgslcblas`, `-lm`: are additional libraries needed, for the BLAS implementation and math. BLAS provides standard basic linear algebra subroutines. A suitable BLAS\n",
    "implementation is provided in the library `libgslcblas.a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `gsl-config`, we can also use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "gcc example.c -Wall `gsl-config --cflags` `gsl-config --libs` -lm\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "To run a program linked with the shared version of the library the operating system must\n",
    "be able to locate the corresponding `.so` file at runtime (not at compile time). If the library cannot be found, the following error will occur:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "./a.out\n",
    "  ./a.out: error while loading shared libraries:\n",
    "  libgsl.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "To avoid this error, either modify the system dynamic linker configuration or define the\n",
    "shell variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the directory where the library is installed.\n",
    "For example, \n",
    "```shell\n",
    "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n",
    "./a.out\n",
    "```\n",
    "prepends `/usr/local/lib` to the variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in several shells and then executes the `example` again. This time successfully."
