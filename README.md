Repository for the 2023 Summer Tutorials on Computational Physics

## Summer tutorials

In preparation for the Fall course, we will collaborate with [Prof. Charlotte Elster](https://www.ohio.edu/cas/elster) to work on modules you should attend, mainly in the second summer session. In the past few years, first-year graduate students were required to sign up for a C-course in the CS department or complete an intro to Python module in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). This year, we will hold the following one-hour tutorials, consisting of lectures and hands-on to help you get started:

| Tutorial      | Tutor | Date | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Basic UNIX navigation and text editors   |   RN     | TBD | 
| Git: basics and more   | CD        | TBD | 
| Basic Python 3 with [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and basic plotting  | KC       | TBD | 
| Basic C/C++ and Fortran | KC        | TBD | 

**Teaching assistants** for these tutorials will be (in alphabetical order) [Kanishk Chauhan](https://www.ohio.edu/cas/kc303218) (KC) and [Rawan Nowier](https://www.ohio.edu/cas/rn757120) (RN).

Attending these tutorials is _highly_ recommended (and in your interest) but not mandatory.
