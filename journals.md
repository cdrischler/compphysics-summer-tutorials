# Navigating scientific journals

Welcome to this mini-tutorial (about 45 min) on navigating scientific journal resources, such as [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), and [Ohio University library](https://www.ohio.edu/library/) for [INPP](https://inpp.ohio.edu/~inpp/) undergraduate students. The **learning goals** are:
* know how to search for (and find!) scientific articles accurately
* know the difference between pre-prints and published articles
* be familiar with important scientific journals in nuclear physics
* know how to access non-open-access journal articles through resources provided by Ohio University
* know how to cite journal articles effectively in LaTeX
* know about common tools to collect and organize scientific references 

This tutorial was given by Christian Drischler (OU) for the 2024 Summer tutorial series for INPP undergraduate students (May 30), organized by [Cody Parker](https://www.ohio.edu/cas/parkerc1) and [Andrea Richard](https://www.ohio.edu/cas/richarda1).

## Scientific journals

_What are common scientific journals I should know about?_ 

The answer to this question depends on your specific scientific research interests and needs. [Journal Citation Reports (JCR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_Citation_Reports) and journal metrics, such as the [Impact Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor), might help be helpful (but also misleading at times). For instance, [here](https://journals.aps.org/metrics) are the metrics for the APS journals.

Below is an _incomplete_ list of popular ([peer-reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review)) journals. (Note that not all articles and/or journals are open-access.)

* [American Physical Society (APS) journals](https://journals.aps.org/about), including 
    - **Physical Review C (PRC)** publishes leading research in all areas of experimental and theoretical nuclear physics. 
    - **Physical Review D (PRD)** publishes leading research in elementary particle physics, field theory, gravitation, and cosmology. 
    - **Physical Review Research** is a peer-reviewed, international, multidisciplinary, open access journal covering all research topics of interest to the physics community.
    - **Physical Review Letters (PRL)** is the **premier APS journal** for current research, providing rapid publication of short reports of important fundamental research in all fields of physics. PRL provides its diverse readership with weekly coverage of major advances in physics and cross-disciplinary developments. 
    - **Physical Review X (PRX)** is an online-only, fully open access, peer-reviewed journal that aims to publish, as timely as possible, exceptional original research papers from all areas of pure, applied, and interdisciplinary physics.
* [Nature](https://www.nature.com/) is a weekly international journal publishing the finest **peer-reviewed research in all fields of science** and technology on the basis of its originality, importance, interdisciplinary interest, timeliness, accessibility, elegance and surprising conclusions. Nature also provides rapid, authoritative, insightful and arresting news and interpretation of topical and coming trends affecting science, scientists and the wider public. [It's interesting to read the [journal metrics](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/about/journal-metrics).]
* [Science](https://www.science.org/) has been at the center of important scientific discovery since its founding in 1880—with seed money from Thomas Edison. Today, Science continues to publish the very best in research across the sciences, with articles that consistently rank among the most cited in the world.
* [Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research - section A (NIM-A)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/nuclear-instruments-and-methods-in-physics-research-section-a-accelerators-spectrometers-detectors-and-associated-equipment) publishes papers on design, development and performance of scientific instruments including complex detector systems and large scale facilities which utilize or study ionizing radiation. This scope includes the development of particle accelerators, particle beam sources, beam transport systems and target arrangements as well as the use of secondary phenomena and their enabling instruments such as neutron sources, synchrotron radiation sources and free electron lasers. It also includes all types of instrumentation for the detection and spectrometry of radiations from high energy processes and nuclear decays, as well as innovative instrumentation for nuclear reactors, nuclear security, nuclear medical diagnoses and therapy, astrophysics, planetary science, and environmental protection. 
* [Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B (NIM-B): Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/nuclear-instruments-and-methods-in-physics-research-section-b-beam-interactions-with-materials-and-atoms) accepts original manuscripts on the fundamental interactions between energetic particle beams and matter, along with related technologies and applications. 
* [Review of Scientific Instruments (RSI)](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi) publishes novel advancements in scientific instrumentation, apparatuses, techniques of experimental measurement, and related mathematical analysis. Its content includes publication of regular articles, review articles, perspectives, and tutorials on instruments and techniques of experimental measurement covering all areas of science, including physics, chemistry, and biology. Special Topics may also be published on new developments or on recently held workshops or conferences in instrumentation., 
* [Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0954-3899) publishes theoretical, experimental and computational research in nuclear and particle physics including all interface areas between these fields. The journal also publishes articles on nuclear and particle astrophysics.
* [Nuclear Physics A](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/nuclear-physics-a) focuses on the domain of nuclear and hadronic physics and includes the following subsections: Nuclear Structure and Dynamics; Intermediate and High Energy Heavy Ion Physics; Hadronic Physics; Electromagnetic and Weak Interactions; Nuclear Astrophysics

Many of these website provide helpful tools, such as **exporting citations in the BibTeX format** [e.g., see "Export Citation" [here](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.226503)] and setting up email alerts. Many of them also suggest a citation style for properly citing the resources.


## Researching scientific journals

_There are so many journals - how do I find the specific article I'm looking for?_

Below are several websites where you can search databases across journals (and much more). They are very helpful tools in your daily research:

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) is a free distribution service and an open-access archive for nearly 2.4 million scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. **Materials on this site are not peer-reviewed by arXiv.** [arXiv is a very popular [**pre-print**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint) archive.] 

**Tip: arXiv allows for downloading the source files, including LaTeX files (if used) and high-resolution figures, e.g., for your talks!** You can find the download link on the right-hand side - give it a try [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15696).

**Another tip: arXiv provides [lists of new and recent submissions](https://arxiv.org/) on its homepage to keep you informed at all times. For instance, [here](https://arxiv.org/list/nucl-th/new) you can find the list of new physics submissions.**

[inspirehep](https://inspirehep.net/): community hub that helps researchers to share and find accurate scholarly information in high energy physics [Don't worry if you are working in low-energy physics!]

Feel free to explore different reference managers and choose the one that best suits your needs and interests. See also [here](https://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=695148&p=4928673) for more information.


## Accessing published articles

_How do I access published articles for which access is typically restricted?_

Ohio University provides resources to access scientific articles published in a wide range of journals. Using a proxy link is a common and straightforward way to do so.

One way to use these resources is by setting two different [bookmarks](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarks-firefox#w_how-do-i-bookmark-a-page) for **proxy links** in your browser: one for Ohio University (for when OU has a subscription to the journal) and another one through OhioLink (if the subscription is available that way).   

For OU subscription journals (which is a lot), create a web browser bookmark with the location: 
```
javascript:void(location.href=%22http://proxy.library.ohio.edu/login?url=%22+location.href);  
```
For Ohio Link, create the bookmark with the location: 
```
javascript:void(location.href=%22http://proxy.ohiolink.edu:9099/login?url=%22+location.href);  
```

Notice that these minimalistic `javascript`s append the proxy link to the current URL in your browser. This could also be done manually. 

**Now, let's access restricted journal articles:**

When on the journal page for a specific article, click the bookmark:

* For the OU proxy link, you are re-routed to authenticate and then re-routed back to the journal page, but now with access (if OU has a subscription). 
* For OhioLink, you are re-routed to Ohio Link to select “Ohio University” and then an authentication page. Then, you are automatically rerouted back to the journal page, now with access (assuming there is a subscription through OhioLink).

**Tip: If an article (or any other item such as books) you need is not available,  you can request it through [Interlibrary Loan](https://www.ohio.edu/library/services/borrowing/interlibrary-loan) provided by University Libraries.**
