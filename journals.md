Two different bookmarks in my browser for proxy links. One through Ohio University (for when OU has a subscription to the journal) and one through OhioLink (if the subscription is available that way).   
* For OU subscription journals (which is a lot), I create a web browser bookmark with the location: javascript:void(location.href=%22http://proxy.library.ohio.edu/login?url=%22+location.href);  
*  Or, for Ohio Link I have a bookmark with the location: javascript:void(location.href=%22http://proxy.ohiolink.edu:9099/login?url=%22+location.href);  

When on the journal page for a specific article, click the bookmark. For the OU proxy link, you're re-routed to authenticate and then re-routed back to the journal page, but now with access (if OU has a subscription). For OhioLink, you're re-routed to Ohio Link to select “Ohio University” and then an authentication page. Then you're automatically rerouted back to the journal page, but with access (assuming there is a subscription through OhioLink).
