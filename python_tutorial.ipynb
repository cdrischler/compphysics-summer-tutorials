    "Python is amongst the simplest and most powerful programming languages used in all fields of science and engineering. Because of its ease of use and a remarkable documentation by the makers of python and people around the world, answers to most of our questions regarding the syntax, what functions to use, etc. can be found everywhere on the internet. In this tutorial, we will go over the basics of python while providing you with links to useful websites and documentation to familiarize yourself with basic python and commonly used libraries (modules).\n",

    "Before diving into the libraries, let's familiarize ourselves with the basics of python and see what all python alone can do. [Beginners Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers) has a lot of helpful tutorials that we highly recommend.\n",

    "'and', 'or', 'not', and comparison operators (<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=) fall under boolean operators. 'not' operator requires only one argument and it simply negates the result. For instance, not Ture == False. 'and' and 'or' require two arguments. The output of 'and' is True if both arguments are true. The output of 'or' is True if one of the arguments is true. The comparison operators hold straightforward mathematical meaning. We present some examples to make it clear."
