    "Python is amongst the simplest and most powerful programming languages used in all fields of science and engineering. Because of its ease of use and a remarkable documentation by the makers of python and people around the world, answers to most of our questions regarding the syntax, what functions to use, etc. can be found everywhere on the internet. In this tutorial, we will go over the basics of python while providing you with links to useful websites and documentation to familiarize yourself with basic python and commonly used libraries (modules).\n",

    "Before diving into the libraries, let's familiarize ourselves with the basics of python and see what all python alone can do. [Beginners Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers) has a lot of helpful tutorials that we highly recommend.\n",

    "'and', 'or', 'not', and comparison operators (<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=) fall under boolean operators. 'not' operator requires only one argument and it simply negates the result. For instance, not Ture == False. 'and' and 'or' require two arguments. The output of 'and' is True if both arguments are true. The output of 'or' is True if one of the arguments is true. The comparison operators hold straightforward mathematical meaning. We present some examples to make it clear."

Thus, we can have as many output variables returned from the fucntions as we need and they can be of any datatype. We can also write functions without return, e.g., if we just want to print something. A few examples are provided below. \n",

    "7. (Optional) Write a function that takes two paramters, generates a matrix (or a 2D array) of size 10 by 10, with elements from a normal distribution with mean = parameter1 and standard deviation = parameter2. Change the elements of the array by multiplying the array by 100 and rounding the elements to the lower integer. Generate a second 10 by 10 array of ones and chnage its elements to 0 if the corresponding elements in the first array are below its mean value. Print both arrays and perform a matrix multiplication of the two. Also calculate the mean and standard deviation of the resultant matrix. Return the results.\n",
