    "# Tutorial: Git/GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "`Git` is a **distributed version control system (VCS)** created to track changes in source code throughout the software development process. \n",
    "\n",
    "**It enables multiple developers to collaborate on a project, manage various file versions, and easily revert to earlier versions when necessary.** \n",
    "\n",
    "`Git` is widely adopted and is regarded as the standard for version control in software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Git?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaboration:**  \n",
    "Git facilitates collaboration among multiple developers working on the same project, allowing them to work concurrently and merge their changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version History:**  \n",
    "Git provides a complete history of your project, making it easy to revert to previous versions if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backup and Recovery:**  \n",
    "Since each user has a full copy of the repository, it serves as a backup. The project can be restored from any user's copy if the main server goes down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Important note: it only serves as a backup if the repository is cloned on multiple independent devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flexibility:**  \n",
    "Git's branching and merging capabilities allow for flexible workflows, making it easy to manage complex projects and experiment with new ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version Control:**  \n",
    "`Git` tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to see who made changes, when they were made, and what those changes were.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distributed Architecture:**  \n",
    "Unlike centralized systems, each user has a complete copy of the repository, including its entire history. This feature enables offline work and simplifies collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Branching and Merging:**  \n",
    "`Git` allows the creation of separate branches for developing new features or fixing bugs without affecting the main codebase. These branches can be merged back together later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Staging Area:**  \n",
    "The staging area (also known as the index) lets you select specific changes to include in your next commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commit:**  \n",
    "A commit is a snapshot of your changes, creating a new version of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remote Repositories:**  \n",
    "`Git` enables you to connect to remote servers (such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) for sharing your work and collaborating with others."
